# Kaggle What's Cooking?

## About

This is practice for using Tensorflow on the [What's Cooking](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking-kernels-only) training set.

## How to use

- `docker-compose up` will bring up the jupyter notebook instance and then you just navigate to `localhost:8888` using the token printed.

## Results

The current results are ~73.7% accurate. At the time of writing, the current leaders are about ~82% accurate.

## Notes

- The results were never submitted because it runs out of memory on kaggle's platform.
- While it would be great to be #1 on the leaderboard, that wasn't the objective. Instead, it was about learning to use tensorflow.
